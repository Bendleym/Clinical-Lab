Clinical Workstation Downtime & Rapid Replacement Lab
Overview

This project simulates a real-world healthcare IT scenario in which a clinical workstation fails during active use. The objective is to restore functionality immediately to minimize disruption to patient care while documenting the incident according to service desk best practices.

Hospitals prioritize rapid recovery over prolonged troubleshooting. This lab demonstrates the ability to triage incidents, deploy replacement hardware, restore user access, and perform root cause analysis afterward.

Scenario

A physician or nurse workstation becomes unusable during active clinical operations. Immediate access to systems is required for patient care.

Goals:

• Restore working access as quickly as possible
• Provide replacement hardware if needed
• Preserve workflow continuity
• Document the incident
• Diagnose root cause without delaying operations

Environment

Physical Components:

• Primary workstation (Windows device)
• Replacement workstation or laptop
• Network connection
• Printer (optional)

Software/Systems Simulated:

• Windows login environment
• User profile access
• Shared resources
• Network connectivity
• Standard productivity applications

Incident Response Workflow
1. Initial Triage

Identify symptoms and determine probable category:

• Hardware failure
• Software malfunction
• Network connectivity issue
• Authentication problem

Basic checks performed:

• Power status
• Display output
• Network connection
• Login capability

2. Rapid Replacement Deployment

To prevent workflow disruption:

• Deployed spare workstation
• Connected to network
• Verified system functionality
• Confirmed user could log in
• Ensured access to essential resources

This approach prioritizes operational continuity.

3. Access Restoration

Re-established user environment:

• Login access
• Network connectivity
• Shared resources
• Application availability
• Peripheral access (if applicable)

4. Incident Documentation

Created service record including:

• Time reported
• Observed symptoms
• Actions taken
• Replacement deployment
• Current status
• Escalation notes

5. Root Cause Analysis

Performed after operations stabilized.

Possible causes evaluated:

• Hardware failure
• OS corruption
• Profile issues
• Network faults
• Peripheral conflicts

Failed system removed from active use pending repair.

Key Skills Demonstrated

• Incident triage under pressure
• Customer-focused problem solving
• Hardware replacement procedures
• User access restoration
• Documentation discipline
• Root cause troubleshooting
• Operational continuity mindset

Relevance to Healthcare IT

Healthcare environments require:

• Minimal downtime
• Immediate response
• Clear communication
• Accurate documentation
• Safety-first decision making

This simulation reflects real service desk and field technician workflows in clinical settings.

Potential Enhancements

Future iterations could include:

• Active Directory user provisioning simulation
• Network outage scenarios
• Printer failure response
• Multi-device incidents
• Ticketing system integration
