# 🏥 Clinical Workstation Failure Response Lab  
### Healthcare IT Tier 1 Incident Simulation

This project simulates a real-world Tier 1 IT support incident in a hospital environment where a clinical workstation fails during active use. The focus is on restoring functionality quickly while maintaining patient safety, documentation accuracy, and proper escalation procedures.

Healthcare environments prioritize **continuity of care**, so this lab emphasizes a replacement-first response rather than prolonged troubleshooting.

## 🎯 Scenario

A physician reports that a workstation used for charting and order entry has become unresponsive during active patient care.

The support technician must:

- Restore functionality immediately
- Minimize disruption to clinical workflow
- Protect patient data
- Document the incident properly
- Isolate the faulty device for investigation

---

## 🧠 Response Strategy

Healthcare IT support often follows this priority order:

1. **Restore care delivery immediately**
2. Provide a replacement device
3. Secure the affected system
4. Document the incident
5. Escalate if needed
6. Perform root-cause analysis later

## 🛠️ Lab Environment

- Windows 10/11 workstation (simulated clinical device)
- Spare workstation for replacement
- Network connectivity validation
- Local admin troubleshooting tools
- Incident documentation template
- Simulated ticket record

---

## 🚑 Step 1 — Incident Intake

The user reports:

> “My computer froze and I can’t access the patient chart.”

### Actions Taken

- Verified device location and user
- Confirmed urgency level (active clinical use)
- Avoided risky actions that could worsen downtime
- Prepared replacement device

## 💻 Step 2 — Immediate Replacement

A preconfigured spare workstation was deployed to restore functionality quickly.

### Actions Taken

- Connected replacement device to network
- Verified login capability
- Confirmed access to clinical applications (simulated)
- Ensured user could resume work

## 🔐 Step 3 — System Isolation

The failed workstation was removed from service for safety and investigation.

### Actions Taken

- Disconnected network access
- Tagged device for IT review
- Preserved system state for diagnostics
- Prevented further clinical use

## 📝 Step 4 — Incident Documentation

Accurate documentation is critical in healthcare IT environments.

### Information Recorded

- User and department
- Device asset identifier
- Time of failure
- Symptoms observed
- Actions taken
- Replacement device issued
- Escalation status

## 📡 Step 5 — Escalation & Follow-Up

The incident was prepared for Tier 2 review.

### Next Steps

- Hardware diagnostics
- OS integrity check
- Patch status review
- Event log analysis
- Root cause determination
- Device reimaging if required
